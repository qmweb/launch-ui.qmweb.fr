# Guidelines
- Avoid comments that just repeat what the code does.
  - ❌ `// increment i by 1` → `i++`
- Only add comments for:
  - Complex algorithms, tricky logic, or non-obvious behavior.
  - Backend-oriented or domain-specific processes where the intent isn’t clear from code.
  - Special cases or workarounds (why something is done in a specific way).

- For front-end primitives, utilities, or simple functions:
  - Prefer **self-explanatory names** and clean code instead of comments.
  - Cursor should **not generate comments automatically** unless explicitly asked.

# Examples
✅ `const isSold = property.status === "sold";`   // no comment needed
✅ `// Special case: fallback when API returns empty array`  // allowed
❌ `// set isSold to true if property is sold`       // unnecessary
